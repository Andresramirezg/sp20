<p>Hi friend! I’m Tony, and I’m a senior studying Computer Science from a lovely SoCal town known as Irvine. I’m so happy to be teaching my favorite class at Cal. Outside of class, I enjoy playing ball and listening to rap. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions or just want to talk!</p>
