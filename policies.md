- **Homeworks:** Homeworks are weekly assignments that focus on a particular topic. They must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions. Your two lowest homework scores will be dropped. Homeworks have both visible and hidden autograder tests. The visible tests are mainly sanity checks, e.g a probability is <= 1, and are visible to students while they do the assignment. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are doing the assignment.  
- **Labs:** Labs are weekly assignments that complement the homeworks. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, and all lab autograder tests are visible. Your two lowest lab scores will be dropped. 
- **Vitamins (undergrad only):** Vitamins are weekly short assignments to check that you are keeping up with lectures. Vitamins should take less than 10 minutes to complete. Your two lowest vitamin scores will be dropped.
- **Projects:** Projects are two week long assignments that synthesize multiple topics.
- **Midterms:** We will have one midterm this semester. Logistics to be announced later.
- **Final:** Final exam logistics will be announced later. 
- **Undergrad vs. grad:** All students enrolled in the graduate version of the course (CS C200 or Stat C200C, i.e. Data 200) will be graded according to the Graduate grading scheme. Students enrolled in the undergraduate version of the course (Data 100) can opt for the graduate grading scheme, which involves a final project. All students in Data 100 who complete a final project will be scored under both grading schemes and given the higher of the two scores.

## Late Policy
For all assignments – Assignments are due at 11:59 pm, but there will be a short submission grace period to accommodate last-minute submission issues. 

Homeworks, labs, and vitamins - These assignments will not be accepted late. The 2 lowest homework, labs, and vitamins will be dropped.

Projects - Projects are marked down by 10% per day, **up to two days**. After two days, project submissions will not be accepted. 


## Collaboration Policy (don’t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.
