## A Few Logistical Changes In Response to COVID-19

To address concerns about the coronavirus, we have <span style="color:#C0392B">made a few adjustments to how we run our discussions and labs</span>. Please read the following information carefully and refer to Piazza if you need more clarifications/details. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this challenging time!

### All Lab Sections are Now Office Hours

We have converted all of the lab slots to office hours. Given the virtual format, both lab and office hours are treated the exact same.

### Discussion Sections are Condensed with Video Walkthroughs

To accommodate students' shifting demands, we will be condensing our discussion sections and eliminating those with less attendance. In substitution, we will be posting discussion video walkthroughs on the **syllabus** page.</span>
